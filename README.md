### Tools
The following tools were used during the development process.

1. Sass (scss syntax)
2. Bootstrap (for responsive layout and html components such as navigation bars, slider, dropdown buttons and others)
3. jQuery (for interactive UI elements)
4. Gulp (for development task manager)
5. HTML5
6. Git

### Further development

For further development or customization you can follow my recommendations:

1. Clone repo
2. Install node.js and gulp (list of plugins for automatization you can find in devDependencies in package.json)
3. Start "gulp watch" command in root folder (local http-server will starts automatically)
4. Add your code (scss compiler, js minifier, browser autoreload and other fancy stuff will be aplied when files saved)
5. For building use default command "gulp"
